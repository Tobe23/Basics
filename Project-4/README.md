# Shell Scripting
Shell scripting helps to automate repetitive task. Bash scripts are essentially a series of commands and instructions that are executed sequentially in a shell. You can create a shell by saving a collection of commands in a text file with a .sh extension. These scripts can be executed directly from the command line or called from other scripts.

## Shell Scripting Syntax Elements
